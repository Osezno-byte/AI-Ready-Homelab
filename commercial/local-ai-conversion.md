# Local AI Conversion Package

### **Bring AI to your homelab — privately.**

Everything stays inside your network.

---

## ✅ Why Local AI?

When you run AI agents on cloud platforms, they see:

* Your network topology
* Service configurations
* System logs and errors
* Backup strategies
* Personal data and usage patterns

**Most homelabbers don't want that data leaving their network.**

That's why this package focuses on **local-only AI**:
* No cloud API calls
* No ongoing subscription costs
* Air-gap compatible
* Full privacy control
* Zero vendor lock-in

---

## ✅ Standard — $497

Perfect for users who want local AI without the pain.

### What's Included

**Local AI Setup**:
* Ollama or LM Studio installation and configuration
* Recommended model selection (LLaMA3, Mistral, or Qwen)
* GPU optimization (if available) or CPU fallback tuning
* Model quantization guidance for your hardware

**MCP Integration**:
* MCP server configuration for local endpoints
* Agent bundle deployment (3 essential agents):
  - ha-yaml-validator (prevents automation bugs)

## ✅ Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a GPU?

**No, but it helps.**

* **CPU-only**: Works fine for 8B models (llama3.1:8b, mistral:7b)
* **GPU**: Faster inference, can run larger models (32B-70B)

We'll recommend the best model for your hardware.

### What if I don't have enough RAM?

We can:
* Use smaller quantized models (4-bit instead of 8-bit)
* Recommend hardware upgrades (cost-effective options)
* Fall back to cloud-assisted "hybrid mode" for complex tasks

### Can I use this with my existing homelab?

**Yes.** This integrates with:
* Home Assistant
* Docker/Proxmox
* Frigate NVR
* pfSense
* n8n
* PostgreSQL/SQLite databases

We adapt to your infrastructure, not the other way around.

### What if I already have Ollama installed?

**Great!** We'll:
* Audit your current setup
* Optimize configuration
* Add MCP integration
* Deploy agent suite
* Charge normal package price (no discount for partial setup, as integration work is the same)

### How much technical knowledge do I need?

**Standard Package**: Comfortable with Linux terminal, basic Docker knowledge
**Pro Package**: Same as Standard (we handle the complexity)

If you can SSH into your homelab and run `docker ps`, you're ready.

### Do you offer training for teams?

**Yes.** Contact us for:
* Team workshops (3-5 people)
* SMB implementation packages
* Ongoing managed services

Pricing varies based on team size and scope.
