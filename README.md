# AI-Ready Homelab Framework

<!-- CI Badges will be added after GitHub Actions go live -->

### **Local-First. Privacy-First. SRE-Driven. AI-Operable.**

Most homelabs end up as a pile of YAML, forum snippets, and half-documented Docker stacks.
This framework changes that.

This is the **first public AI-operable homelab architecture** built around:

1. **Local-only AI agents** (Ollama, LM Studio — no cloud required)
2. **SRE-style governance and runbooks**
3. **Supervised automation using MCP tools + guardrails**
4. **A repeatable, documented operating model**

The goal isn't more tools.
The goal is **reliability, clarity, and safe AI automation**.

---

## TL;DR — What This Framework Actually Is

- ✅ Local-first by default (no cloud requirement)
- ✅ Privacy-first (sanitized before cloud planning, no raw logs leave LAN)
- ✅ SRE governance (STATUS workflow, verification windows, runbooks)
- ✅ Hybrid AI architecture (cloud plans, local executes)
- ✅ MCP tooling with supervised agents (CSE guardrails)
- ✅ Proven in production (HA, Frigate, Proxmox, n8n, pfSense)

---

## ✅ Why This Exists

Homelabs are becoming real infrastructure. But:

* configs drift
* services break silently
* backups aren't tested
* nothing is documented
* AI integration is unsafe or hacky
* and no one has a system for all of it

This framework gives you:

* structure
* governance
* runbooks
* safety
* and AI-assisted operations that don't expose your data

**Everything stays local.**
Your model, your logs, your topology — all on your LAN.

---

## ✅ Real-World Results

These patterns are battle-tested in a production homelab:

* **46% reduction** in Home Assistant database size
* **83% elimination** of camera disconnections
* **4× faster** automation development
* **12–20× faster** backup validation
* **Fully air-gapped AI operations**
* **Zero credential leaks** via secrets handling
* **100% backup coverage** after implementing DR framework

<sub>Metrics captured from STATUS.md history and DR drill logs.</sub>

### Case Study: How STATUS.md Caught a Frigate Regression

After a Docker restart, the cameras looked fine but STATUS.md showed increased reconnections within 12 hours.
The verification window caught the regression early, and the fix was documented, preventing future failures.

**This is why verification windows matter.**

---

## How It Works (High-Level Flow)

1. **Plan**
   Cloud AI (or local model) generates a plan for a change or diagnosis.

2. **CSE Review**
   The plan is checked against CSE guardrails:
   - scope
   - verbs (read/write/forbid)
   - redlines
   - approval TTLs

3. **Sanitize (Hybrid & Cloud-enhanced modes)**
   Logs and configs are run through the `preflight_sanitize` n8n workflow.
   Only the sanitized output is sent to cloud AIs.

4. **Local Execution**
   MCP tools execute the approved steps locally:
   - Home Assistant
   - Docker
   - Proxmox
   - Frigate
   - pfSense
   - n8n
   - Database

5. **Evidence → STATUS.md**
   Before/after metrics and logs are recorded.
   A verification window ensures stability before the change is considered "complete."

---

## Why It Works

Homelabs become unreliable not because people are careless, but because nothing enforces rhythm, documentation, or safe change.

This framework gives your homelab the same guardrails that keep real infrastructure sane.

---

## ✅ What Makes This Different (Your Moats)

### 1. SRE Governance (Primary Moat)

Not just templates — an actual operating cadence:

* `STATUS.md` (daily/weekly reliability snapshot)
* `PENDING-WORK.md` (tech debt + verification queue)
* Change-management rhythm
* Incident lifecycle
* DR test matrix
* Runbook discipline
* Human-in-the-loop gating

This is the piece no one else is shipping.

### 2. Agent-Assisted Runbooks (Secondary Moat)

Agents don't free-run.
They follow documented procedures.

Includes examples for:

* Frigate diagnosis
* Home Assistant YAML validation
* Docker failures
* Backup verification
* Segmentation drift
* Network diagnostics

All under **CSE supervision** so nothing touches your infra without checks.

### 3. Privacy-First, Local-Only AI (Default Mode)

This system is designed for:

* Ollama
* LM Studio
* Qwen
* LLaMA3
* Mistral
* GPU or CPU inference
* Air-gapped operation

Optional: cloud-assisted "planning mode"
Default: **full privacy, zero cloud dependency.**

### 4. Complete System, Not a Bag of Tools (Tertiary Moat)

Competitor repos = MCP servers.
This repo =
✅ Architecture
✅ Governance
✅ Procedures
✅ Agents
✅ Documentation
✅ Local-AI discipline
✅ Safety guardrails
✅ A monetizable implementation path

You're not configuring a tool.
You're adopting an operating system for your homelab.

---

## ✅ Who This Is For

✔ Homelab users who want reliability instead of chaos
✔ SMB owners who self-host
✔ Privacy-conscious infrastructure users
✔ People who want AI assistance without cloud exposure
✔ Anyone who wants a professional operating model for their home infrastructure

---

## ✅ If You're New to All of This (The Simple Path)

**Start here if you're new:**

1. **Copy the `samples/` templates**
   ```bash
   cp samples/STATUS.sample.md STATUS.md
   cp samples/PENDING-WORK.sample.md PENDING-WORK.md
   ```

2. **Fill out STATUS.md once**
   Add your current services, their status, and any recent changes.

3. **Add one runbook (Docker or HA)**
   Document how you restart a service or check logs.

4. **Do one verification window**
   Make a small change, mark it "pending verification" for 48 hours.

5. **That's it**
   You've started the SRE cadence. Build from there.

**People love a low-friction entry point.** Start small, build discipline, expand naturally.

---

## ✅ Three Ways to Use This

### 1. Quick Start (10 minutes)

If you just want structure:

* Copy the `samples/` folder
* Start filling out STATUS and PENDING-WORK
* Add runbooks for your top 3 services
* Done

### 2. Intermediate (2–3 hours)

If you want governance:

* Implement STATUS cadence
* Add runbooks for HA, Docker, backups
* Add DR test plan
* Begin agent-assisted runbooks (local-only)

### 3. Full Implementation (6–12 hours)

If you want the complete operating system:

* Deploy local AI model
* Configure MCP servers
* Install agent suite
* Harden CSE supervision
* Segment your homelab
* Implement the full SRE kit
* Begin automated reliability reviews

## ❌ What This Is Not

- **Not** a "magic AI" that runs your homelab for you
- **Not** a set of random MCP tools
- **Not** a home-automation shortcut or a scripted stack
- **Not** a full enterprise SRE handbook

This is a governance and operations framework for people who want reliability, privacy, and AI assistance without handing their homelab to the cloud.

---

## Security Model Summary

- 🔒 **Local-only execution** — all actions run on your LAN via MCP tools
- 🔍 **Sanitized cloud planning** — no raw logs or personal data ever leave the LAN
- ⛔ **Redlines enforce hard blocks** for WAN rules, volume deletion, credential changes, destructive ops
- ✅ **Approvals with TTL** ensure risky operations require human confirmation
- 🧹 **No raw persistence** — raw logs/configs never get stored inside workflows
- 🛡️ **CSE acts as the safety officer** — all AI actions go through policy checks
