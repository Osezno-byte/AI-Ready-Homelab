# Implementation Showcase Template

If you'd like to share your setup, consider including:

* Hardware overview
* Core services (HA, Docker, Proxmox, etc)
* Your STATUS cadence
* Example runbook
* Architecture diagram or photos
* Lessons learned and improvements planned

Sharing helps others learn and improve their homelabs.
