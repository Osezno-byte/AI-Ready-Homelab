# Contributing to AI-Ready Homelab

Thank you for your interest in contributing.
This framework is built by the community, for the community.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Share Your Implementation

If you're using this framework:
* Open a Discussion and describe your setup
* Document what worked well and what didn't
* Share metrics and results
* Help others by answering questions

Real-world usage reports are valuable feedback.

### 2. Improve Documentation

Documentation is critical to this project.

Ways to help:
* Fix typos or unclear instructions
* Add examples to existing templates
* Create new runbook examples
* Improve architecture diagrams
* Translate documentation (if multilingual)

### 3. Contribute Templates

New templates are always welcome.

We need:
* Service-specific runbooks (Plex, Jellyfin, Nginx, etc.)
* Additional SRE patterns
* Agent specifications for new use cases
* Network topology examples
* Backup and DR procedures

### 4. Report Issues

Found a bug or problem?

* Check if the issue already exists
* Provide clear reproduction steps
* Include relevant logs or screenshots
* Suggest a fix if you have one

### 5. Suggest Features

Have an idea?

* Open a Discussion first (not an Issue)
* Explain the use case
* Describe expected behavior
* Get community feedback

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`)
3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing formatting and structure
   - Test your changes if applicable
   - Update relevant documentation

## Review Process

### What We Look For

Good contributions:
* Solve a real problem
* Follow existing patterns
* Include documentation
* Are well-tested
* Add value to the community

Contributions we might reject:
* Too broad in scope (break into smaller PRs)
* Duplicate existing functionality
* Lack documentation or examples
* Break existing functionality
* Don't fit the framework's goals

### Timeline

* **Small fixes** (typos, docs): Reviewed within 1-2 days
* **Medium changes** (new templates): Reviewed within 3-5 days
* **Large changes** (new features): Discussed first, then reviewed when ready

## Project Goals

Keep these in mind when contributing:

1. **Privacy-first** - Local AI by default, cloud optional
2. **SRE discipline** - Governance and reliability over features
3. **Production-ready** - Real-world tested, not theoretical
4. **Accessible** - Clear docs for all skill levels
5. **Opinionated** - Better to have a clear way than many mediocre ways

## Thank You

Every contribution, no matter how small, helps make this framework better for everyone.

Together we're building the standard for AI-operable homelab infrastructure.
